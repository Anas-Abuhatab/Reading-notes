# The summary 

> By running the git remote command, you can view the short names, such as “origin,” of all specified remote handles.

> By using git remote -v, you can view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names.

## Like this `~/Reading-notes$ git remote -v`
+ `origin  https://github.com/Anas-Abuhatab/Reading-notes (fetch)`

* `origin  https://github.com/Anas-Abuhatab/Reading-notes (push)`
