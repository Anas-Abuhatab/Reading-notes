# The Summary :

## Please note that i write here what i see its very important and my external note .

### HTML CH#1(STRUCTURE) Summary: 

* The attribute name should be written in lowercase.
* HTML pages are text documents.
* HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
* Tags are often referred to as elements.
* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
* Attributes require a name and a value.
* To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.

### HTML CH#8(Extra Markup) Summary: 

* The id attribute is known as a global attribute because it can be used on any element.
* Examples of block elements are `<h1>, <p>, <ul>, and <li>`.
* Examples of inline elements are`<a>, <b>, <em>, and <img>`.
* The `<div>` element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.
* The `<span>` element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.
* An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page — and in that window you can see another page. The term iframe is an abbreviation of inline frame.
>Example`<iframe src="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=moma+new+york &amp;output=embed" width="450" height="350" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" seamless; </iframe> `

* The `<meta>` tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
* Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.

### HTML CH#17(HTML5 Layout) Summary: 

* The `<section>` element should not be used as a wrapper for the entire page (unless the page only contains one distinct piece of content). If you want a containing element for the entir page, that job is still best left to the `<div>` element.
* IE9 was the first version of Internet Explorer to allow CSS rules to be associated with these new HTML5 layout elements. In order to style these elements using earlier versions of IE, you need to use a simple JavaScript known as the** HTML5 shiv or HTML5 shim**.
* HTML5 block elements:header, section, footer, aside, nav, article, figure, figcaption, hgroup, div.
* To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google. 

### HTML CH#18(Process & Design) Summary:

* It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return. 
* It's important to understand w XX ho your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return. 
* Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
* Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
* Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
* You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.
* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.

### JS CH#1(The ABC of Programming) Summary:

* A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal. 
* Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.
* Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically.
* To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
* It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript
file.
* JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the .js extension.
* The HTML `<script>` element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like the `<link>` element can be used to load a CSS file).
* If you view the source code of the page in the browser the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.
