# The Summary

### JS CH3#(Object Literals) Summary:

##### Programmers use a lot of name/value pairs:
* HTML uses attribute names and values.
* CSS uses property names and values.
In JavaScript:
* Variables have a name and you can assign them a value of a string, number, or Boolean.
* Arrays have a name and a group of values. (Each item in an array is a name/value pair because it has an index number and a value.)
* Named functions have a name and value that is a set of statements to run if the function is called.
* Objects consist of a set of name/value pairs (but the names are referred to as keys).

### JS CH35#(Document Object Model) Summary:

* The browser represents the page using a DOM tree.
* DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes, element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes. 
* You can select element nodes by their id or cl ass attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.
* Whenever a DOM query can return more than one node, it will always return a Nadel i st.
* From an element node, you can access and update its content using properties such as textContent and i nnerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques.
* An element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements that are siblings of each other.
* In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery). 
* Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree .
