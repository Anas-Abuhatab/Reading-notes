## 2- Loops :

Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.
###### Example 
`for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {
  // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.}`
> There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times. (Note that it's possible that number could be zero!)

#### for loop rule :`for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])`

#### while statement 
`look like :while (condition)
  statement`

###### :stop_sign: Avoid infinite loops. Make sure the condition in a loop eventually becomes falseâ€”otherwise, the loop will never terminate! The statements in the following while loop execute forever because the condition never becomes false
