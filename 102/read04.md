# The summary 


# JavaScript
 (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

There are 3 ways to declare a JavaScript variable:


- Using var
- Using let
- Using const

In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.

# This is different from algebra #

You can declare many variables in one statement.
Start the statement with var and separate the variables by comma
