# Pain and Suffering

Over the next 10 weeks of this course, you’ll learn far more than most people learn in 2 years of study in a University setting about software development, web app development, best practices, and the Python language overall. That accelerated learning environment is great, but it does come at a price that is felt in all spheres of life: physical, mental, and emotional.

That price is pain, the pain of growth.


# Beginners Guide to Big O 

Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.

Anyone who’s read Programming Pearls or any other Computer Science books and doesn’t have a grounding in Mathematics will have hit a wall when they reached chapters that mention O(N log N) or other seemingly bizarre syntax. Hopefully this article will help you gain an understanding of the basics of Big O and Logarithms.
